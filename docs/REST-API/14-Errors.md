# Errors

If an API request is successful, PagerDuty will respond to it with HTTP status code 2XX and the resources that match the query.

If the API request is unsuccessful, PagerDuty will respond with a corresponding HTTP error status code and the response body will contain PagerDuty error details.

The response body (with error details) will have the following properties:

### Error Response

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "Error Message String",
        "code": 2001,
        "errors": [
            "human-readable error details",
            "more details"
        ]
    }
}
```

### HTTP Responses

The HTTP response can be used to determine if the request was successful, and if not, whether the request should be retried.

| Code | HTTP Definition | Description |
|:--------------|:------------------|:------|
| 200 | OK | The request was successful |
| 201 | Created | The request was successful and a new resource was created. |
| 204 | No Content | The request was successful. No content is returned. |
| 400 | Bad Request | Caller provided invalid arguments. Please review the response for error details. Retrying with the same arguments will *not* work. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Caller did not supply credentials or did not provide the correct credentials. See [Authentication](../../docs/REST-API/02-Authentication.md). |
| 402 | Payment Required | The PagerDuty account does not have access to one or more abilities needed to complete this request. Use the [Account Abilities API](https://developer.pagerduty.com/api-reference/9def78ed82b74-list-abilities) to determine which abilities the account supports. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Caller is not authorized to view the requested resource. |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource was not found. |
| 408 | Request Timeout | The request took too long to process. Please try again. |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | The caller is making requests too frequently. Wait a moment before making further requests and make them at a reduced rate. See [Rate Limiting](../../docs/REST-API/04-Rate-Limiting.md). |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Internal error occurred while processing request, likely due to transient issues. Please try again. **Tip:** We recommend adding retry logic to your client to automatically try your request again later. |

### PagerDuty Error Codes

In the case of an error, the PagerDuty error code can give further details on the nature of the error.

This list of error codes is not exhaustive, but is representative of the kinds of errors you will see in API responses.
