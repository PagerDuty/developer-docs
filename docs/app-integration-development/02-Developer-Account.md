# Developer Account FAQ

#### Do I need a developer account?
If you already have a PagerDuty account, no. All PagerDuty accounts have access to our developer tools and you can get started [here](../../docs/app-integration-development/03-Register-an-App.md). 
If you do not have a PagerDuty account then you can sign up for a Developer account [here](/sign-up/).

#### How many users can I add to my developer account?

You may add 3 full users and 2 stakeholder users to your developer account.


#### Are there any other restrictions for PagerDuty developer accounts?

Developer account users cannot receive SMS or voice/phone notifications. These cannot be enabled for any reason. If you require these notification types for testing, please purchase a paid PagerDuty account.


#### How does my developer account differ from my regular account?

Other than the limits on notifications and the user count, there are no differences - Partner Developer Accounts are meant for those without access to a paid PagerDuty account.


#### Can I convert my developer account into a paid account?

No, this account is meant for developing and testing apps and integrations with PagerDuty. Please sign up for a PagerDuty trial and purchase an account for commercial use.


#### What if I need more users on my developer account?

Unfortunately, the user restrictions on developer accounts cannot be increased for any reason. If you require more users, please purchase a paid PagerDuty account.


#### Is there any cost for a developer account?

No, PagerDuty developer accounts are free!
