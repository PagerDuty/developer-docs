# App Functionality

Once you have [registered your app](../../docs/app-integration-development/03-Register-an-App.md), add functionality to make it useful.

### PagerDuty App Functionality


| App Functionality   | Description|
|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| [Events Integration](../../docs/app-integration-development/06-Events-Integration.md) |  Send machine events **from** your tool **to** PagerDuty over our asynchronous [Events API](../../docs/events-API-v2/01-Overview.md). This is the best way for monitoring tools to connect with PagerDuty in order to trigger incidents. |
| [Simple Install Flow](../../docs/app-integration-development/06-Events-Integration.md#simple-install-flow-optional-but-recommended)|  If you're using the Events API, your users can quickly connect to PagerDuty directly from your tool with the Simple Install Flow! [See Demo](https://acme.pagerduty.dev) |
| [Classic User OAuth](../../docs/app-integration-development/08-OAuth-Functionality.md#classic-user-oauth)|  Connect to our [REST API](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/) as a PagerDuty User to administer PagerDuty or access data (create an on-call schedule, get a list of team members, etc). |
| [Scoped OAuth](../../docs/app-integration-development/08-OAuth-Functionality.md#scoped-oauth)|  Connect to our [REST API](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/) as a PagerDuty App or a PagerDuty User with detailed scopes to administer PagerDuty or access data (create an on-call schedule, get a list of team members, etc). |

### More ways to integrate with PagerDuty

These platform features are not available through PagerDuty's app configuration framework (yet!) but are still available for your app to use.

|REST API Token|If you need account-level access to a PagerDuty account, you can [request a token from PagerDuty admin users](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/generating-api-keys#section-rest-api-keys).|
|Webhooks|PagerDuty will send messages **to** your tool when certain activities occur. For example: when an incident is triggered, when a note is added to an incident, etc). <br/><br/>There are 2 ways to create a webhook extension: <ul><li>Over the REST API with the [/extensions endpoint](https://api-reference.pagerduty.com/#!/Extensions/post_extensions) </li><li>[In the PagerDuty web interface](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/webhooks)</li></ul>|


### Which app functionality is right for me?

Use our [API Picker](../../docs/app-integration-development/05-API-Picker.md) resource to choose the app functionality that's right for your needs. See [OAuth Functionality](../../docs/app-integration-development/08-OAuth-Functionality.md) for a more detailed description of the various OAuth functionalities.
