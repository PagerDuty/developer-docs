# API Tools & Code Samples

Looking for ways to improve your workflow, or for inspiration and creative ways to use PagerDuty APIs? This directory contains all third-party open source tools and projects known to us known to us which support our current public APIs.

<!-- theme:info -->
> ### Community Support
> PagerDuty does not endorse or provide technical support for any API libraries or tools created and maintained by our user community.

## PagerDuty-Samples on GitHub
[PagerDuty-Samples](https://github.com/PagerDuty-Samples/) is a collection of sample apps and examples for working with the PagerDuty API and platform. This is a place where you'll find helpful projects that will explain how to do common tasks using common languages.

Please create a post in our [Developer forums](https://community.pagerduty.com/forum/c/developer) if you have any requests for future samples.

## PagerDuty MCP Server

[PagerDuty MCP Server](https://github.com/pagerduty/pagerduty-mcp-server) allows your agentic systems to work with PagerDuty APIs.

## PagerDuty CLI
[PagerDuty CLI](https://github.com/martindstone/pagerduty-cli/wiki/PagerDuty-CLI-User-Guide) is a command-line interface for PagerDuty. It's intended to be easy to install and use, and good at common tasks for both administrators and responders. It uses the PagerDuty REST API to communicate with PagerDuty. It’s implemented in TypeScript and Node.js, using the wonderful oclif library.

## Get Involved

Have you built any tools that use PagerDuty APIs? Let us know in our [Developer forums](https://community.pagerduty.com/forum/c/developer)!

We're always happy to add new projects to our directory. Please note that all submissions must support or rely on current, non-deprecated, public APIs to be included in the directory.
