### Alert De-Duplication

Every alert event has a `dedup_key`: a string which identifies the alert triggered for the given event. The `dedup_key` can be specified when submitting the first trigger event that creates an alert. If omitted, it will be generated automatically by PagerDuty and returned in the Events API v2 response.

Submitting subsequent events with the same `dedup_key` will result in those events being applied to an open alert matching that `dedup_key`. Once the alert is resolved, any further events with the same `dedup_key` will create a new alert (for `trigger` events) or be dropped (for `acknowledge` and `resolve` events). Alerts will only be created for events with an `event_action` of `trigger`. Acknowledge or resolve events without a currently open alert will not create a new one.

Subsequent events for the same `dedup_key` will only apply to the open alert if the events are sent via the same `routing_key` and routed to the same Service as the original trigger event. Subsequent acknowledge or resolve events will be dropped if they are either sent via a different `routing_key` or routed to a different Service compared the original trigger event.

A trigger event sent without a `dedup_key` will always generate a new alert because the automatically generated `dedup_key` will be a unique [UUID](../../docs/REST-API/06-Types.md#uuid).

Alerts can be further grouped into Incidents, for centralizing incident response and context. For more information on the way events, alerts, and incidents interact, please see [this knowledge base article](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/alerts).

### Event Action Behavior

Three actions can be specified in the `event_action` parameter. Each represents a different type of activity.

| Event Action  | Behavior in PagerDuty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `trigger`     | A new alert is opened or a trigger log entry is created on an existing alert if one already exists with the same `dedup_key`.<br/> <br/>Use this event action when a new problem has been detected. Additional triggers _may_ be sent when a previously detected problem has occurred again.                                                                                                                                         |
| `acknowledge` | The incident referenced with the `dedup_key` will enter the acknowledged state.<br/> <br/>While an incident is acknowledged, it won't generate any additional notifications, even if it receives new trigger events.<br/> <br/>Use this event action to indicate that someone is presently working on the problem.                                                                                                                   |
| `resolve`     | The incident referenced with the `dedup_key` will enter the resolved state.<br/> <br/>Once an incident is resolved, it won't generate any additional notifications. New trigger events with the same `incident_key` / `dedup_key`as a resolved incident won't re-open the incident. Instead, a new incident will be created.<br/> <br/> Use this event action when the problem that caused the initial trigger event has been fixed. |

  This example shows how to send a trigger event without a dedup_key.

### Responses and Limits

See the [Events API v2 Overview page](../../docs/events-API-v2/01-Overview.md#response-codes--retry-logic) for response codes and limits.

### Context Properties

These properties can be used to attach informational assets to the incident record. Each element of these arrays is an [object](../../docs/REST-API/06-Types.md#object).

#### The `images` Property

This property is used to attach images to the incident. Each object in the list has the following properties:

| Name   | Required | Description                                                                                        |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src`  | Yes      | The source (URL) of the image being attached to the incident. This image must be served via HTTPS. |
| `href` | No       | Optional URL; makes the image a clickable link.                                                    |
| `alt`  | No       | Optional alternative text for the image.                                                           |

#### The `links` Property

This property is used to attach text links to the incident. Each object in the list has the following properties:

| Name   | Required | Description                                                                            |
| ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `href` | Yes      | URL of the link to be attached.                                                        |
| `text` | No       | Plain text that describes the purpose of the link, and can be used as the link's text. |

## Try it Out

The Events API v2 requires a `routing_key`. You can [create an Events API v2 integration on any PagerDuty service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-events-API-v2) in order to get a routing key that will route an event to that service. You can also use an integration key from a [ruleset](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/rulesets#section-global-rulesets) to send alert events.
