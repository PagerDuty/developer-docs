## Editing the "Sidebar"/Table of Contents
Documents are hidden by default, to provide a link to a document via the Table of Contents you must edit the Table of Contents file: `toc.json`

Documentation on how `toc.json` works can be [found here.](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/platform/4.-documentation/d.table-of-contents.md)

## File Naming
There isn't a strict file naming convention. *However*, files have broadly been organized into 'topic' folder, and file names begin with the order they appear in the Table of Contents.

## Deployment
Simply merging to the `main` branch will deploy docs to production.
